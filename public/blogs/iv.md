You must have heard the saying "You are the average of the 5 people you are with," right?

That's true. Interacting with like-minded people who are strongly passionate about their craft can level up your game, but finding these so-called "like-minded people" is the big issue that you and I face.

Only if there were a place where these people come together now and then ðŸ¤”

Wait, they do exist! Communities are the solutions to this problem.

Apple's founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were also active members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which had an influential role in the personal computer revolution of our world.

Communities are groups of people who meet together to discuss or listen to others who are experienced in their craft.

There are a lot of communities around you, and you might not even be aware of them.

There are both technical communities as well as communities that have fun.

Some of the technical communities are Google Developer Group and FOSS United, which have local chapters that are actively present throughout India.

Communities also have the added advantage of giving a lot of exposure and networking opportunities if you are found to be enthusiastic and an active member.

Once you start to understand the amount of value communities bring to the table, you will start to engage more and more, even leading to hosting events on your own.

The ability to host events and manage people is one of the top skills you can add to your resume and speak a lot about in interviews.

If you are still on the fence about deciding to join communities, attend an event, and you will get the energy and enthusiasm. Cheers :)
